MicroScope allows to select up to 50 favourite organisms.
Those organisms are showed first when using the :ref:`selector <selector>` for faster access
(see :ref:`favourite-organisms-usage`).

This functionality is disabled for guests and only available for logged Annotators.

How to make my own selection of favourites organisms?
-----------------------------------------------------

This functionnality uses the advanced selector (in **Genome Selection** mode).
See :ref:`here <advanced-selector>` for help on how to use it.

When you open the selector, the list of your current favourite organisms
is displayed in the **Selection Zone**.
