Why should I need to create an account?
---------------------------------------

This interface is dedicated to new account registration.
Creating an account on the MicroScope platform will allow you to:

* request for a delivery of service.
* save :ref:`user preferences <display-preferences>`.
* save :ref:`genecarts` and :ref:`genomecarts`.
* receive the newsletter and participate in user surveys.

What information is needed to create a new account?
---------------------------------------------------

Fill in all the required fields (see the image below to find which are mandatory).
The most important ones are the email address and the chosen username.
Both must be unique else the system won't allow you to create a new account.

The tooltips indicate if the fields are incorrectly formatted.
The rules are as follows:

  - for the username: lower case non-accented letters, or digits, no space, 3 to 20 characters
  - for your first and last name: only non-accented letters, spaces, ``-`` and ``'``; your last name will be converted to capital letters
  - for the name of your institution, laboratory and address: non-accented letters, digits, spaces and some characters (``_``, ``(``, ``)``, ``&``, ``,``, ``/``, ``.``, ``'``, ``\``, and ``-``)
