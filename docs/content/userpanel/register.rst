Why should I need to create an account?
---------------------------------------

This interface is dedicated to new account registration. Creating an account on the MicroScope platform will allow you:

* to request for a delivery of service.
* to save some personal settings.
* to save Genes Carts.
* to set a list of favourite organisms.
* to be informed directly about LABGeM’s communications.
* to participate to user surveys.


What information is needed to create a new account?
---------------------------------------------------

Fill in all the required fields. Most important ones are the email address and the chosen username (lower case letters, or digits, no space, 3 to 20 characters). Both must be unique, else the system won’t allow you to create a new account.
