Gene Carts
##########

The result of many tools available in the MicroScope platform is a list of candidate genes which can be saved in a «Gene Cart». The «Gene Carts» interface allows the user to perform various operations on these gene carts: intersection, union, difference, download corresponding nucleic or protein sequences, launch  `JalView tool <http://www.jalview.org/>`_ to perform multiple alignments, etc. Moreover these carts can be explored using the Keywords Search tool.

.. tip:: Gene Carts content is saved within your account settings, so your selections will persist into our databases even if you logout from your session.


Gene Cart Overview
------------------

* **Item #2. Upload a Gene Cart:**
 
	Select a XML file containing Gene Cart data from your computer by using the «**Browse**» button, then click on the «**Upload Cart**» button to import the XML file content into the Gene Cart interface.
	
* **Item #3. Genomic Objects operations:**

	This menu allows the user to perform operations on Gene Carts content.
	
		* `Move <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-move-genomic-objects-to-another-gene-cart>`_ a selection of Genomic Objects contained in a Gene Cart into another one.
		* `Copy <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-copy-genomic-objects-to-another-gene-cart>`_ a selection of Genomic Objects contained in a Gene Cart into another one.
		* `Delete <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-delete-genomic-objects-from-gene-cart>`_ a selection of Genomic Objects from Gene Cart.
	
* **Item #4. Gene Carts operations:**
	
	This menu allows the user to perform operations on Gene Carts.

		* Get the `Intersection <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-get-the-intersection-between-2-gene-carts>`_ between 2 Gene Carts content and move the result into a new Cart.
		* Get the `Difference <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-get-the-difference-between-2-gene-carts>`_ between 2 Gene Carts content and move the result into a new Cart.
		* `Merge <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-merge-2-gene-carts>`_ the content of 2 Gene Carts into a new Cart.

.. tip:: You can do this kind of operations **only on 2 Gene Carts at a same time**.

* **Item #5. Gene Cart name:**

	`Change the name <http://microscope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/userpanel/genesbasket.html#how-to-rename-a-gene-cart>`_ of a Gene Cart.

* **Item #6. FASTA tool:**

	Export the Nucleic or Proteic content of a Gene Cart in FASTA format.
	
* **Item #7. JalView tool:**

	Launch the `JalView <http://www.jalview.org/>`_ tool (Nucleic or Proteic) for a given Gene Cart content.

* **Item #8. Export Gene Cart:**

	Export a Gene Cart content into a XML file which can be shared with your collaborators.

* **Item #9. Delete Gene Cart:**
 
	Delete definitively a Gene Cart. ( **Warning: the content will also be deleted** ).

* **Item #10. Delete Gene Cart:**
 
	Export the gene annotation in tsv format file.
	
How to move Genomic Objects to another Gene Cart?
-------------------------------------------------

1. Select some Genomic Objects in the Gene Cart of interest.

How to get the intersection between 2 Gene Carts?
-------------------------------------------------

1. Fill **at least** 2 Gene Carts with some content.

.. image:: img/bas10.png
	:width: 100%

2. In the select menu, choose the 2 Gene Carts you want to intersect. This means **you’ll get the common Genomic Objects contained in the 2 Carts**.

.. image:: img/bas11.png
	:width: 25%

3. Click on the CARTS: **INTERSECT** button
4. The intersection between the 2 Gene Carts content will be moved into a new Cart, called by default ’**INTERSECT**’. 

.. warning:: **If you need to perform another ’Intersect Operation’, do not forget to rename the Cart called ’INTERSECT’. Else, the content will be overwrited.**

How to fill a Gene Cart with some Genomic Objects?
--------------------------------------------------

Some MicroScope’s tools allow the possibility to save Genomic Objects into a Gene Cart.
Overall, check for the availability of a **EXPORT TO GENE** CART button above a Genomic Objects list.

1. Click on the **EXPORT TO GENE CART** button to open the ’Export Interface’ popup.

.. image:: img/bas21.png

2. Select your ’destination’ Cart in the select menu. (Create a new one if necessary by clicking on the **NEW CART** button).
3. Click on the **SAVE** button.
4. All the Genomic Objects listed below the **EXPORT TO GENE CART** button will be transferred and saved into your ’destination’ Cart.
