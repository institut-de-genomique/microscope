Genome Carts
############

A « Genome Cart » is a named list of related genomes used to select them quickly in various tools.
To do so, genome carts are used in the :ref:`advanced-selector`.
Among those carts, there is a special one, called the « favourite » (this replace the list of favourite organisms found in previous versions).
This cart can be accessed quickly in some tools.

.. tip:: The content of genome carts is saved within your account settings, so your selections will persist into our databases even if you logout from your session.

.. warning:: For performance reasons, a genome cart can't contain more than 500 genomes.
    Also, you can't create more than 10 genome carts.
