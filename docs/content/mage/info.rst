Overview of the annotation editor
=================================

How to access to the Gene Annotation Editor?
--------------------------------------------

There are two ways of accessing the Gene Annotation Editor:

* 1- click on a genomic object on the genomic map
* 2- click on a label in the table of genomic objects which is below the genomic map

NB : requesting information via the GetInfo button only calls up a read-only Gene Annotation Editor window.


Overview of the Gene Annotation Editor
--------------------------------------

.. image:: img/overview0.png

The Gene Annotation Editor window is made of 4 sections:

* a **toolbar** that allows access to different functionalities
* the **current annotation** of the genomic object. This section can be modified by the annotator (with sufficient rights).
* the **primary annotation** of the genomic object. It correspond to the MicroScope pipeline automatic annotation (if it is a first annotation) or to the databank annotation (if it is a reannotation project).
* the **Method results** section. This section gives an access to the results obtained by the different tools used for the syntactic and functional annotation process.


How to use the Gene Annotation Editor toolbar?
----------------------------------------------

.. image:: img/view1.png

It contains several buttons allowing access to different functionalities:

* the sequence (nucleic and protein) of the genomic object
* the annotation history of the genomic object
* **5’/3’**: the sequence (nucleic and protein) of the genomic object
* **TrEMBL alignments**: visualisation of the alignments with TrEMBL best hits
* **SwissProt alignments**: visualisation of the alignments with SwissProt best hits
* **Phyloprofile**: this tool provides a list of all CDSs (from all replicons) that have the same phylogenetic profile (presence/absence of homologue in others species) than the current genomic object. Note: query can be slow.
* **PubMed**: this functionality opens a new window that shows the references that have been linked to this genomic object on PubMed
* **KEGG**: this functionality opens the KEGG description corresponding to the annotated EC number(s)
* **Brenda**: this functionality opens the Brenda entry corresponding to the annotated EC number(s)
* **MicroCyc**: this functionality opens a new window showing information related to the genomic object in the MicroCyc database

How to fill the Gene Annotation form?
-------------------------------------

As shown in the figure below, not all fields can be modified by the annotator. Furthermore, some of them are required and other are optional. These fields have to be filled after the careful analysis of the different methods results. If your are working on other object than CDS, you may have a different form, if a required field for CDS appear in your form, it's still required.

.. image:: img/editor2.PNG

.. tip:: If one of the required field is missing or wrongly filled a warning will appear in the window.


What are the different annotation "Status"?
---------------------------------------------

* **inProgress** : the annotator has not finished the expert annotation
* **finished** : the annotator has finished the expert annotation
* **Curated** : the expert annotation has been reviewed by a specialist of the functional process in which the CDS product is involved
* **Artefact** : An artefactual CDS corresponds to a false prediction by the gene detection program. An artefactual CDS should never be similar to any proteins from the databanks (except if the same erroneous annotation has been made in another genomes)
* **chkSeq** : this status is used by the annotator to flag potential sequencing errors in the sequence. When the sequencing is performed at Genoscope, these chkSeq sequences will be sent to the people working in the finishing team. They will then check the assembly to see if the sequence quality is good or not. If needed they can perform some additional PCRs to enhance the data.
* **chkStart** : the annotator suspects that a start position readjustment might be needed for the CDS, but hasn’t done it yet.

How to use the "MetaCyc reaction" field?
----------------------------------------

This field allows user to link one ore more metabolic reactions from MetaCyc (BioCyc) to the current edited gene.

.. image:: img/editor4.png


* a - Reactions presented at the top of the field have been manually curated by an annotator.
* b - A multiple selection list gives quick access to all predicted (unselected) or curated (selected) reactions linked to this gene.
* c - A search box allows one to quickly access MetaCyc reactions corresponding to either EC numbers from previous EC number field or a given keyword.

**Search box :**

Clicking on the “EC” button will search all MetaCyc reactions corresponding to the EC number from the “EC number” field.

The keyword search will look for all MetaCyc reactions having an identifier, a name or involving a compound similar to the given keyword.

**Search result :**

.. image:: img/editor5.png

The search returns a list of MetaCyc reactions, with :

* the reaction identifier and name. Identifier is clickable and open the BioCyc reaction card.

And in some cases :

* Genes of the organism already linked to this reaction (eg. first row of the example). Genes are flagged with :

	* “validated” : reaction has been manually linked to this gene by users.
	* “annotated” : reaction has been linked to homologous gene and transferred here from a close genome.
	* “predicted” : reaction has been linked to this gene by the pathway-tools algorithm.

* If the reaction has no known coding genes but belongs to a pathway predicted to exist in the current organism, a clickable link to the MetaCyc pathway description is given (eg. fourth row of the example).

The “Reset” button deletes all results


How to use the "Rhea reaction" field?
-------------------------------------

This field allows user to link one ore more metabolic reactions from **Rhea** to the current edited gene.

You will find the PMID of a publication directly on Pubmed as shown on the figure below. You can also find PMIDs in the "References" section of the UniProt entries.

.. image:: img/editor3.png

If this field is filled you will have a direct access to the publications on PubMed by clicking on the **Pubmed** button on top of the Gene annotation editor window.


How to use the "Additional data" field?
--------------------------------

The **Comments** field is dedicated to the annotators who want to leave some notes for themselves or for others annotators from the project.



How to use the "Class" field?
-----------------------------

The **Class** annotation categories are useful for assigning a "confidence level" to each gene annotation. It has been inspired by the "protein name confidence" defined in `PseudoCAP <http://www.pseudomonas.com/>`_ (Pseudomonas aeruginosa community annotation project).

This information is not given by the automatic functional annotation procedure, except in case of functional annotation transfer from a genome being annotated with MaGe.

The different classes are:

* **1a : Function from experimental evidences in the studied strain**
* **1b : Function from experimental evidences in the studied species**
* **1c : Function from experimental evidences in the studied genus**
* **2a : Function from experimental evidences in other organisms**
* **2b : Function from indirect experimental evidences (e.g. phenotypes)**
* **3 : Putative function from multiple computational evidences**
* **4 : Unknown function but conserved in other organisms**
* **5 : Unknown function**

Similarities SwissProt / TrEMBL
===============================

What is UniProt?
----------------

The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The mission of UniProt is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible ressource of protein sequence and functional information.

The UniProt Knowledgebase consists of two sections:

* **Swiss-Prot** which contains high quality manually annotated and non-redundant protein sequences. This database brings together experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions.
* **TrEMBL** which contains protein sequences associated with computationally generated annotation and large-scale functional characterization that await full manual annotation.

More than 99% of the protein sequences provided by UniProtKB are derived from the translation of the coding sequences (CDS) which have been submitted to the public nucleic acid databases, the EMBL-Bank/GenBank/DDBJ databases. All these sequences, as well as the related data submitted by the authors, are automatically integrated into UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

**More**: http://www.uniprot.org/

COGnitor
========

What is COGnitor?
-----------------

COGnitor compares a sequence to the COG database by using BLASTP. Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) were established by comparing protein sequences encoded in complete genomes, representing major phylogenetic lineages. Each COG consists of individual proteins or groups of paralogs from at least 3 lineages and thus corresponds to an ancient conserved domain.

**More**: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/

**Reference**:

`Tatusov RL, Koonin EV, Lipman DJ. A genomic perspective on protein families. Science. 1997 Oct 24;278(5338):631-7. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9381173>`_

How to read COGnitor results?
-----------------------------

The first column indicates the identifier of the COG family the protein is similar to. If you click on the identifier, a new window will pop-up, presenting the COG’s description page on the NCBI website. The second column gives the similarity score and the third and fourth columns give the amino acid positions between which the proteins align. The last 2 columns indicate the general class to which the COG belongs and the function describing the COG family

.. tip:: A protein is classified in a COG if it has at least 3 Best Hits with proteins classified in the same COG and being members of 3 different clades. A protein can thus be classified in more than one COG.

============
InterProScan
============

What is InterPro?
-----------------

InterPro is an integrated database of predictive protein "signatures" used for the classification and automatic annotation of proteins and genomes. InterPro classifies sequences at superfamily, family and subfamily levels, predicting the occurrence of functional domains, repeats and important sites. InterPro adds in-depth annotation, including GO terms, to the protein signatures.

More: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/

Reference: `Hunter S, et al. InterPro: the integrative protein signature database. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D211-5. Epub 2008 Oct 21. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18940856>`_

Which databases are used in InterPro?
-------------------------------------

InterPro combines a number of databases (referred to as member databases) that use different methodologies and a varying degree of biological information on well-characterised proteins to derive protein signatures. By uniting the member databases, InterPro capitalises on their individual strengths, producing a powerful integrated database and diagnostic tool (InterProScan).

The member databases use a number of approaches:

* `PRODOM <http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php>`_: provider of sequence-clusters built from UniProtKB using PSI-BLAST.
* `PROFILE <http://prosite.expasy.org/>`_ (PROSITE patterns): provider of simple regular expressions.
* `PROFILE <http://prosite.expasy.org/>`_ and `HAMAP <http://hamap.expasy.org/cgi-bin/unirule/unirule_browse.cgi?browse=description&context=HAMAP>`_: provide sequence matrices.
* `PRINTS <http://130.88.97.239/dbbrowser/sprint/>`_ provider of fingerprints, which are groups of aligned, un-weighted Position Specific Sequence Matrices (PSSMs).
* `PANTHER <http://www.pantherdb.org/>`_, `PIRSF <http://pir.georgetown.edu/>`_,  `PFAM <http://pfam.xfam.org/>`_, `SMART <http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/>`_, `TIGRFAMs <http://www.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/tigrfams/index.cgi>`_, `GENE3D <http://www.cathdb.info/>`_ and `SSF <http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/>`_ (SUPERFAMILY): providers of hidden Markov models (HMMs). 
* `CDD <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml>`_ Conserved Domains and Protein Classification 
* `SFLD <http://sfld.rbvi.ucsf.edu/django/>`_ A hierarchical classification of enzymes that relates specific sequence-structure features to specific chemical capabilities


Diagnostically, these resources have different areas of optimum application owing to the different underlying analysis methods. In terms of family coverage, the protein signature databases are similar in size but differ in content. While all of the methods share a common interest in protein sequence classification, some focus on divergent domains (e.g., Pfam), some focus on functional sites (e.g., PROSITE), and others focus on families, specialising in hierarchical definitions from superfamily down to subfamily levels in order to pin-point specific functions (e.g., PRINTS). TIGRFAMs focus on building HMMs for functionally equivalent proteins and PIRSF always produces HMMs over the full length of a protein and have protein length restrictions to gather family members. `HAMAP`_ profiles are manually created by expert curators they identify proteins that are part of well-conserved bacterial, archaeal and plastid-encoded proteins families or subfamilies. PANTHER build HMMs based on the divergence of function within families. SUPERFAMILY and Gene3D are based on structure using the SCOP and CATH superfamilies, respectively, as a basis for building HMMs.

•	The VirulenceFinder dataset which includes virulence genes for Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli/Shigella and Enterococcus
•	A manually curated dataset of reference virulence genes for Escherichia coli (Coli_ref).

The original virulence factors classification from VFDB has been hierarchically attributed to each gene as frequently as possible, in order to provide a functional interpretation of your results.
New virulence factors have also been added to VirulenceFinder and Coli_ref database to describe as best as possible the gene functions.

•	Result interpretation: Score from Blast, E-value, orderQ (rank of the BLAST hit for the protein of the query genome) and orderB (rank of the BLAST hit for the protein of the virulence database).

|

**Additionnal information on VF classes:**

|

They are divided into 4 main classes as proposed by VFDB:

•	Offensive virulence factors
•	Defensive virulence factors
•	Nonspecific virulence factors
•	Regulation of virulence-associated genes

A gene can be involved in many classes. For exemple, the gene kpsE (Capsule polysaccharide export inner-membrane protein KpsE) from E. coli can act both as an offensive virulence factor and a defensive virulence factor.

So the VF classes corresponding is “Offensive virulence factors, Invasion, Defensive virulence factors, Antiphagocytosis“ which correspond to :

1. Offensive virulence factors

  1.1 Invasion

2. Defensive virulence factors

  2.1 Antiphagocytosis

What is IntegronFinder?
-------------------------------------------------------

IntegronFinder is a tool that detects integrons in DNA sequences with high accuracy. It is accurate because it combines the use of HMM profiles for the dectection of essential protein, the site-specific integron integrase, and the use of Covariance Models for the detection of the recombination site, the attC site.
This tool also annotates gene casettes however we use our own annotations to make it run.
IntegronFinder distinguishes 3 types of elements:

* Complete integron: integron including an integrase and at least one attC site
* In0 element: integron integrase only, without any attC site nearby
* CALIN element: The clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrases (CALIN) are composed of at least two attC sites

Macromolecular System Finder (MacSyFinder) provides a flexible framework to model the properties of molecular systems (cellular machinery or pathway) including their components, evolutionary associations with other systems and genetic architecture. Modelled features also include functional analogs, and the multiple uses of a same component by different systems. Models are used to search for molecular systems in complete genomes or in unstructured data like metagenomes. The components of the systems are searched by sequence similarity using Hidden Markov model (HMM) protein profiles. The assignment of hits to a given system is decided based on compliance with the content and organization of the system model.
