Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocols provide powerful new approaches to study transcriptomes.
These approaches, called RNA-Seq, consist in converting transcripts to cDNAs, which are then sequenced with high coverage.
This functionality offers different tools to explore transcriptomics data.

RNA-Seq homepage displays the list of available projects.

By Clicking on the arrow available on the left of each project, user can expand the associated functionalities.
