How to read the table ?
-----------------------

In the table, each line describes a gene related to an enzymatic reaction and a KO in this pathway.

* **Label**: Label of the protein. If you click on the label, you access to the Gene annotation window
* **Region**: '+' indicate the genes presence in the region selected and '-' indicate abscence
* **Gene**: Gene name of the protein
* **EC number**: EC number associated with the protein
* **Product**: Product description of the protein
* **Evidence**: Status of the annotation: "validated" mean the gene is manual annotated and "automatic" mean the gene annotation come from automatic annotation system
* **Enzyme Description**: description of enzymatic function
* **KO**: ID number of KEGG Ortholog entry
* **KO Definition**: Functional description of KO
* **KO EC number**: EC number associated with the KO

How to explore the KEGG map ?
-----------------------------

On the KEGG map, reactions matching genome annotations are highlighted in green and reaction matching region annotations are highlighted in yellow.
A reaction or gene box is red means gene is manual annotated.
